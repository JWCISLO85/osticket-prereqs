  The first stage was to create a virtual machine in Azure. I created a Resource Group then created a Windows 10 virtual machine with 2 virtual CPUs so that it had sufficient resources. This also allowed me to create a virtual network.

<h2> Step 2</h2>
The next stage was to enable Internet Information Services on the virtual machine. Click on start and look and type ISS and   IIS is a crucial component for running osTicket on a Windows server. It provides the necessary web server environment for the application to function properly and interact with users through the internet. I turned CGI, Common HTTP Features and IIS Management Console. To enable IIS with CGI Control Panel > Programs and Features > Turn Windows Features on or off > World Wide Web Services > Application Development Features > CGI (check) Expand Internet Information Services. To enable IIS Management Console Internet Information Services > Web Management Tools > IIS Management Console

<h2> Step 3 Download and Install PHP Manager for IIS and Rewrite Module </h2>
  
![Download PHP Manager](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d405e80-f043-484a-9378-d7671d279ee4)



 PHP Manager provides a user-friendly interface for configuring PHP settingsPHP manager can be downloaded at https://www.iis.net/. I then created a new folder C:/PHP.

![Download Rewrite Module](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9937e075-e212-4526-9666-762f9cc677c2)

Rewrite module in IIS (Internet Information Services) is a powerful tool that allows you to modify the URL structure of web requests before they are processed by the web server. Can be downloaded at https://www.iis.net/.



<h2> Step 4 Download MYSQL and Visual C++ </h2>

OSTicket needs a database to store users so it needs MYSQL to be installed. It can be downloaded from https://www.mysql.com/downloads/

![MY SQL passowrd](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b445a9a-8f8d-49cd-90c4-be69f1e4bf64)

I created a password and user name that was needed to configure database in OSTicket.
